Physical activity and music to support pre-school children's mathematics learning.,2018,"['Elofsson, Jessica', 'Bohm, Anna Englund', 'Jeppsson, Catarina', 'Samuelsson, Joakim']","In order to give all children equal opportunities in school, methods to prevent early differences are needed. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two structured teaching methods: Math in Action, characterised by physical activity and music, and common numerical activities. Children (28 girls, 25 boys) were assigned to 1 of the 2 conditions during a period of 3 weeks (2 times a week for a 30-minute session). The results show that children who learn mathematics in an environment characterised by physical activity and music develop their mathematical abilities significantly more than children who learn mathematics through common number activities. We have also shown that children with different motor skill abilities benefit from learning mathematics in an environment characterised by physical activity and music.

The consistency of sex differences in mental traits at various ages.,1927,"Goodenough, F. L","A review of the findings with respect to differences in the sexes. Problems investigated and reviewed are discussed under the following rubrics: use or comprehension of speech; number concepts, arithmetical reasoning, and computation; reproduction and memory; amount and range of general information; mechanical ability and motor skill. One of the conclusions is that mental differences between the sexes are very small in comparison with the amount of variation found to exist between members of the same sex, and these may be ignored so far as educational procedure is concerned. However, sex differences, according to most investigators, do exist in measurable degree. How these differences have originated is not apparent from the data at hand. A bibliography is appended.

Hitting the target: Mathematical attainment in children is related to interceptive-timing ability.,2018,"['Giles, Oscar T', 'Shire, Katy A', 'Hill, Liam J. B', 'Mushtaq, Faisal', 'Waterman, Amanda', 'Holt, Raymond J', 'Culmer, Peter R', 'Williams, Justin H. G', 'Wilkie, Richard M', 'Mon-Williams, Mark']","Interceptive timing is a fundamental ability underpinning numerous actions (e.g., ball catching), but its development and relationship with other cognitive functions remain poorly understood. Piaget suggested that children need to learn the physical rules that govern their environment before they can represent abstract concepts such as number and time. Thus, learning how objects move in space and time may underpin the development of related abstract representations (i.e., mathematics). To test this hypothesis, we captured objective measures of interceptive timing in 309 primary school children (5-11 years old), alongside scores for general motor skill and national standardized academic attainment. Bayesian estimation showed that interceptive timing (but not general motor capability) uniquely predicted mathematical ability even after we controlled for age, reading, and writing attainment. This finding demonstrates that interceptive timing is distinct from other motor skills with specificity in predicting childhood mathematical ability independently of other forms of attainment and motor capability.

"Disentangling the relationship between children's motor ability, executive function and academic achievement.",2017,"['Schmidt, Mirko', 'Egger, Fabienne', 'Benzing, Valentin', 'Jager, Katja', 'Conzelmann, Achim', 'Roebers, Claudia M', 'Pesce, Caterina']","Even though positive relations between children's motor ability and their academic achievement are frequently reported, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Executive function has indeed been proposed, but hardly tested as a potential mediator. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the mediating role of executive function in the relationship between motor ability and academic achievement, also investigating the individual contribution of specific motor abilities to the hypothesized mediated linkage to academic achievement. At intervals of ten weeks, 236 children aged between 10 and 12 years were tested in terms of their motor ability (t1: cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, motor coordination), core executive functions (t2: updating, inhibition, shifting), and academic achievement (t3: mathematics, reading, spelling). Structural equation modelling revealed executive function to be a mediator in the relation between motor ability and academic achievement, represented by a significant indirect effect. In separate analyses, each of the three motor abilities were positively related to children's academic achievement. However, only in the case of children's motor coordination, the mediation by executive function accounted for a significance percentage of variance of academic achievement data. The results provide evidence in support of models that conceive executive function as a mechanism explaining the relationship that links children's physical activity-related outcomes to academic achievement and strengthen the advocacy for quality physical activity not merely focused on health-related physical fitness outcomes, but also on motor skill development and learning.

A case study: Nonverbal learning disabilities.,2013,"Fine, Jodene Goldenring","Presents a case report of a 12-year-old right-handed boy of European-American descent referred by his pediatrician for concerns regarding emotional ability and possible symptoms of mild autism. A primary concern was Anthony's increasing sadness and anxiety about going to school. His mother noted that he was socially isolated and poorly coordinated. He was reported to feel most comfortable with adults and small children. Anthony's vision was mildly myopic and corrected with glasses. His hearing was evaluated within a year of the assessment and was reported as normal. A review of Anthony's medical records confirmed his mother's report that he was healthy, with no history of serious medical concerns. Neuropsychological testing suggested that Anthony had broadly typical cognitive development with some distinct areas of stronger and weaker functioning. Fine and gross motor skill appeared impaired as did visual perception, visual memory, and visuo-motor integration. Auditory memory benefited from context with recall supported through serial memorization and difficulty with contextual organization of material. Memory of auditory stimuli was sensitive to interference and strategies appeared rigidly bound. Neuropsychological testing of executive functions was generally normal except for emotional regulation and self-monitoring, which were areas of weakness. Academically, Anthony demonstrated strong verbal skills, poor mathematics, and spatially disorganized handwriting with adequate content production. Functionally, Anthony appeared to have poor functioning in social communication and motor skills despite broadly typical intellectual skills.

The relationship between gross motor skills and academic achievement in children with learning disabilities.,2011,"['Westendorp, Marieke', 'Hartman, Esther', 'Houwen, Suzanne', 'Smith, Joanne', 'Visscher, Chris']","The present study compared the gross motor skills of 7- to 12-year-old children with learning disabilities (n = 104) with those of age-matched typically developing children (n = 104) using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2. Additionally, the specific relationships between subsets of gross motor skills and academic performance in reading, spelling, and mathematics were examined in children with learning disabilities. As expected, the children with learning disabilities scored poorer on both the locomotor and object-control subtests than their typically developing peers. Furthermore, in children with learning disabilities a specific relationship was observed between reading and locomotor skills and a trend was found for a relationship between mathematics and object-control skills: the larger children's learning lag, the poorer their motor skill scores. This study stresses the importance of specific interventions facilitating both motor and academic abilities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
Learning and motor skills disorders.,1999,"Elbert, Jean C","Presents a historical perspective, theoretical models, epidemiology, and diagnostic description and critique of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) as they relate to learning and motor skill disorders in children. Specifically, reading disorder, disorder of written expression, mathematics disorder, and developmental coordination disorder are examined. Assessment methods regarding reading, spelling, written language, mathematics, and coordination and motor skills are discussed. General special education services, specific educational interventions according to disorder, cognitive-behavioral, motivational, and strategy instruction as well as other psychosocial approaches to treatments are presented.

Electroencephalographic evidence for a reinforcement learning advantage during motor skill acquisition.,2020,"['Colino, Francisco L', 'Heath, Matthew', 'Hassall, Cameron D', 'Krigolson, Olave E']","The feedback that we receive shapes how we learn. Previous research has demonstrated that quantitative feedback results in better performance than qualitative feedback. However, the data supporting a quantitative feedback advantage are not conclusive and further little work has been done to examine the mechanistic neural differences that underlie the relative benefits of quantitative and qualitative feedback. To address these issues, participants learned a simple motor task in quantitative and qualitative feedback conditions while electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. We found that participants were more accurate and had a larger neural response-the feedback related negativity-when qualitative feedback was provided. Our data suggest that qualitative feedback is more advantageous than quantitative feedback during the early stages of skill acquisition. Additionally, our findings support previous work suggesting that a reinforcement learning system within the human medial-frontal cortex plays a key role in motor skill acquisition.

Age-dependent effect of transcranial alternating current stimulation on motor skill consolidation.,2020,"['Fresnoza, Shane', 'Christova, Monica', 'Bieler, Lara', 'Korner, Christof', 'Zimmer, Ulrike', 'Gallasch, Eugen', 'Ischebeck, Anja']","Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is the application of subthreshold, sinusoidal current to modulate ongoing brain rhythms related to sensory, motor and cognitive processes. Electrophysiological studies suggested that the effect of tACS applied at an alpha frequency (8-12 Hz) was state-dependent. The effects of tACS, that is, an increase in parieto-occipital electroencephalography (EEG) alpha power and magnetoencephalography (MEG) phase coherence, was only observed when the eyes were open (low alpha power) and not when the eyes were closed (high alpha power). This state-dependency of the effects of alpha tACS might extend to the aging brain characterized by general slowing and decrease in spectral power of the alpha rhythm. We additionally hypothesized that tACS will influence the motor cortex, which is involved in motor skill learning and consolidation. A group of young and old healthy adults performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their right hand before and after the tACS stimulation. Each participant underwent three sessions of stimulation: sham, stimulation applied at the individual participant's alpha peak frequency or individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF; alpha-tACS) and stimulation with iAPF plus 2 Hz (alpha2-tACS) to the left motor cortex for 10 min (1.5 mA). We measured the effect of stimulation on general motor skill (GMS) and sequence-specific skill (SS) consolidation. We found that alpha-tACS and alpha2-tACS improved GMS and SS consolidation in the old group. In contrast, alpha-tACS minimally improved GMS consolidation but impaired SS consolidation in the young group. On the other hand, alpha2-tACS was detrimental to the consolidation of both skills in the young group. Our results suggest that individuals with aberrant alpha rhythm such as the elderly could benefit more from tACS stimulation, whereas for young healthy individuals with intact alpha rhythm the stimulation could be detrimental.

Temporal dynamics of Arc/Arg3.1 expression in the dorsal striatum during acquisition and consolidation of a motor skill in mice.,2020,"['Gong, Wan-Kun', 'Ni, Jian', 'Yu, Lan-Fang', 'Wang, Lu', 'Huang, Zhi-Li']","Region- and pathway-specific plasticity within striatal circuits is critically involved in the acquisition and long-term retention of a new motor skill as it becomes automatized. However, the molecular substrates contributing to this plasticity remain unclear. Here, we examined the expression of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) in the associative or dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the sensorimotor or dorsolateral striatum (DLS), as well as in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, during different skill learning phases in the accelerating rotarod task. We found that Arc was mainly expressed in the DMS during early motor learning and progressively increased in the DLS during gradual motor skill consolidation. Moreover, Arc was preferentially expressed in striatopallidal neurons early in training and gradually increased in striatonigral neurons later in training. These data demonstrate that in the dorsal striatum, the expression of Arc exhibits a region- and cell-specific transfer during the learning of a motor skill, suggesting a link between striatal Arc expression and motor skill learning in mice.
